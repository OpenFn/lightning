  Project user permissions determine what a user can and cannot do within a
  project. Projects (i.e., "workspaces") can have multiple collaborators with
  varying levels of access to the resources (workflows, jobs, triggers, runs)
  within.

  The tests ensure both that user "Amy" that has been added as an `editor` for
  project "X", via the creation of a

    %ProjectUser{ user: "Amy", role: "editor", project: "X"}
