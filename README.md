- Filter and search runs to identify issues that need addressing and follow how
  a specific request has been processed
- Configure alerts to be notified on run failures
- Receive a project digest for a daily/weekly/monthly summary of your project
  activity

### Manage

Manage users and access by project.

<p align="center">
  <img width="2560" alt="image" src="https://github.com/OpenFn/lightning/assets/8732845/5411e6a6-14f2-4ff1-a37f-d4156cf40e97">
</p>

### Roles and permissions

Authorization is a central part of Lightning. As such, users are given different
roles which determine what level of access they have for resources in the
application. For more details about roles and permissions in Lightning, please
refer to our
[documentation](https://docs.openfn.org/documentation/about-lightning#roles-and-permissions).

### Roadmap

View our
[public GitHub project](https://github.com/orgs/OpenFn/projects/3/views/1) to
see what we're working on now and what's coming next.

## Getting Started

- If you only want to [_**RUN**_](#run-via-docker) Lightning on your own server,
  we recommend using Docker.
- If you want to [_**DEPLOY**_](#deploy-on-external-infrastructure) Lightning,
  we recommend Docker builds and Kubernetes.
- If you want to [_**CONTRIBUTE**_](#contribute-to-this-project) to the project,
  we recommend
  [running Lightning on your local machine](#run-lightning-locally).

### **Run** via Docker

1. Install the latest version of
   [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)
2. Clone [this repo](https://github.com/OpenFn/Lightning) using git
3. Setup PostgreSQL database with:
   `docker compose build && docker compose run --rm web mix ecto.migrate`
4. Run Lightning and PostgresSQL with: `docker compose up`

By default the application will be running at
[localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000/).

See ["Problems with Docker"](#problems-with-docker) for additional
troubleshooting help. Note that you can also create your own
`docker-compose.yml` file, configuring a postgres database and using a
[pre-built image](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/openfn/lightning)
from Dockerhub.

### **Deploy** on external infrastructure

Head to the [Deploy](https://docs.openfn.org/documentation/deploy/options)
section of our docs site to get started.

For technical guidelines, see [deployment considerations](DEPLOYMENT.md) for
more detailed information.

### **Dev** on Lightning locally

#### Clone the repo and optionally set ENVs

```sh
git clone git@github.com:OpenFn/Lightning.git # or from YOUR fork!
cd Lightning
cp .env.example .env # and adjust as necessary!
```

Take note of database names and ports in particular—they've got to match across
your Postgres setup and your ENVs. You can run lightning without any ENVs
assuming a vanilla postgres setup (see below), but you may want to make
adjustments.

#### Database Setup

If you're already using Postgres locally, create a new database called
`lightning_dev`, for example.

If you'd rather use Docker to set up a Postgres DB, create a new volume and
image:

```sh
docker volume create lightning-postgres-data

docker create \
  --name lightning-postgres \
  --mount source=lightning-postgres-data,target=/var/lib/postgresql/data \
  --publish 5432:5432 \
  -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=postgres \
  postgres:15.3-alpine

docker start lightning-postgres
```

#### Elixir & Ecto Setup

We use [asdf](https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf) to configure our local
environments. Included in the repo is a `.tool-versions` file that is read by
asdf in order to dynamically make the specified versions of Elixir and Erlang
available. You'll need asdf plugins for
[Erlang](https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf-erlang),
[NodeJs](https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf-nodejs)
[Elixir](https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf-elixir) and
[k6](https://github.com/grimoh/asdf-k6).

We use [libsodium](https://doc.libsodium.org/) for encoding values as required
by the
[Github API](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/guides/encrypting-secrets-for-the-rest-api).
You'll need to install `libsodium` in order for the application to compile.

For Mac Users:

```sh
brew install libsodium
```

For Debian Users:

```sh
sudo apt-get install libsodium-dev
```

You can find more on
[how to install libsodium here](https://doc.libsodium.org/installation)

```sh
asdf install  # Install language versions
mix local.hex
mix deps.get
mix local.rebar --force
mix ecto.create # Create a development database in Postgres
mix ecto.migrate
[[ $(uname -m) == 'arm64' ]] && CPATH=/opt/homebrew/include LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/homebrew/lib mix deps.compile enacl # Force compile enacl if on M1
[[ $(uname -m) == 'arm64' ]] && mix compile.rambo # Force compile rambo if on M1
mix lightning.install_runtime
mix lightning.install_schemas
mix lightning.install_adaptor_icons
npm install --prefix assets
```

#### Run the app

Lightning is a web app. To run it in interactive Elixir mode, start the
development server by running with your environment variables by running:

```sh
iex -S mix phx.server
```

or if you have set up custom environment variables, run:

```sh
env $(cat .env | grep -v "#" | xargs ) iex -S mix phx.server
```

Once the server has started, head to [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000)
in your browser.

#### Run the tests

Before the first time running the tests, you need a test database setup.

```sh
MIX_ENV=test mix ecto.create
```

And then after that run the tests using:

```sh
MIX_ENV=test mix test
```

We also have `test.watch` installed which can be used to rerun the tests on file
changes.

## Security and Standards

We use a host of common Elixir static analysis tools to help us avoid common
pitfalls and make sure we keep everything clean and consistent.

In addition to our test suite, you can run the following commands:

- `mix format --check-formatted` Code formatting checker, run again without the
  `--check-formatted` flag to have your code automatically changed.
- `mix dialyzer` Static analysis for type mismatches and other common warnings.
  See [dialyxir](https://github.com/jeremyjh/dialyxir).
- `mix credo --strict --all` Static analysis for consistency, and coding
  standards. See [Credo](https://github.com/rrrene/credo).
- `mix sobelow` Check for commonly known security exploits. See
  [Sobelow](https://sobelow.io/).
- `MIX_ENV=test mix coveralls` Test coverage reporter. This command also runs
  the test suite, and can be used in place of `mix test` when checking
  everything before pushing your code. See
  [excoveralls](https://github.com/parroty/excoveralls).

> For convenience there is a `verify` mix task that runs all of the above and
> defaults the `MIX_ENV` to `test`.

implementations, check out OpenFn Docs:

folder you can find a script for benchmarking Webhook Workflows.

See [Benchmarking](benchmarking/README.md) for more detailed information.

## Troubleshooting

### Problems with environment variables

For troubleshooting custom environment variable configuration it's important to
know how an Elixir app loads and modifies configuration. The order is as
follows:

1. Stuff in `config.exs` is loaded.
2. _That_ is then modified (think: _overwritten_) by stuff your ENV-specific
   config: `dev.exs`, `prod.exs` or `test.exs`.
3. _That_ is then modified by `runtime.exs` which is where you are allowed to
   use `System.env()`
4. _Finally_ `init/2` (if present in a child application) gets called (which
   takes the config which has been set in steps 1-3) when that child application
   is started during the parent app startup defined in `application.ex`.

### Problems with Postgres

If you're having connecting issues with Postgres, check the database section of
your `.env` to ensure the DB url is correctly set for your environment — note
that composing a DB url out of other, earlier declared variables, does not work
while using `xargs`.

### Problems with Debian

If you're getting this error on debian

```
==> earmark_parser
Compiling 1 file (.yrl)
/usr/lib/erlang/lib/parsetools-2.3.1/include/yeccpre.hrl: no such file or directory
could not compile dependency :earmark_parser, "mix compile" failed. You can recompile this dependency with "mix deps.compile earmark_parser", update it with "mix deps.update earmark_parser" or clean it with "mix deps.clean earmark_parser"
```

You need to install erlang development environment `sudo apt install erlang-dev`
[refer to this issue](https://github.com/elixir-lang/ex_doc/issues/1441)

### Problems with Docker

#### Versions

The build may not work on old versions of Docker and Docker compose. It has been
tested against:

```
Docker version 20.10.17, build 100c701
Docker Compose version v2.6.0
```

#### Starting from scratch

If you're actively working with docker, you start experiencing issues, and you
would like to start from scratch you can clean up everything and start over like
this:

```sh
# To remove any ignored files and reset your .env to it's example
git clean -fdx && cp .env.example .env
# You can skip the line below if you want to keep your database
docker compose down --rmi all --volumes

docker compose build --no-cache web && \
  docker compose create --force-recreate

docker compose run --rm web mix ecto.migrate
docker compose up
```

#### Apple Silicon

When running `docker compose up` on Apple Silicon (M1, M2, M3), you might encounter the following error:

```
> [web 20/20] RUN npm install --prefix assets:
0.091 rosetta error: failed to open elf at /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2
0.091  Trace/breakpoint trap
------
failed to solve: process "/bin/sh -c npm install --prefix assets" did not complete successfully: exit code: 133
```

You can solve this by setting the default docker platform to `linux/amd64`, i.e. `DOCKER_DEFAULT_PLATFORM=linux/amd64`.
You can read more on this here: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/71040681/qemu-x86-64-could-not-open-lib64-ld-linux-x86-64-so-2-no-such-file-or-direc

You might also run into:

```
[notice] Application ssl exited: exited in: :ssl_app.start(:normal, [])
 ** (EXIT) an exception was raised:
     ** (ArgumentError) could not call Module.put_attribute/3 because the module Lightning.MixProject is already compiled
         (elixir 1.16.2) lib/module.ex:2360: Module.assert_not_readonly!/2
         (elixir 1.16.2) lib/module.ex:2041: Module.__put_attribute__/5
         (ssl 11.1.4) ssl_app.erl:35: :ssl_app.stop/1
         (kernel 9.2.4) application_master.erl:293: :application_master.start_it_old/4

** (MatchError) no match of right hand side value: {:error, {:ssl, {:bad_return, {{:ssl_app, :start, [:normal, []]}, {:EXIT, {%ArgumentError{message: "could not call Module.put_attribute/3 because the module Lightning.MixProject is already compiled"}, [{Module, :assert_not_readonly!, 2, [file: ~c"lib/module.ex", line: 2360]}, {Module, :__put_attribute__, 5, [file: ~c"lib/module.ex", line: 2041]}, {:ssl_app, :stop, 1, [file: ~c"ssl_app.erl", line: 35]}, {:application_master, :start_it_old, 4, [file: ~c"application_master.erl", line: 293]}]}}}}}}
```

You can resolve this by setting `ERL_FLAGS="+JPperf true"` env to the failing stage.
You can follow this thread on our community forum for more info: https://community.openfn.org/t/lightning-prebuilt-images-throw-no-matching-manifest-for-linux-arm64-v8-in-the-manifest-list-entries/465/15

### Problems with Rambo

When running `mix compile.rambo` on Apple Silicon (an Apple M1/M2, `macarm`,
`aarch64-apple-darwin`) and encountering the following error:

```
** (RuntimeError) Rambo does not ship with binaries for your environment.

    aarch64-apple-darwin22.3.0 detected

Install the Rust compiler so a binary can be prepared for you.

    lib/mix/tasks/compile.rambo.ex:89: Mix.Tasks.Compile.Rambo.compile!/0
    lib/mix/tasks/compile.rambo.ex:51: Mix.Tasks.Compile.Rambo.run/1
    (mix 1.14.2) lib/mix/task.ex:421: anonymous fn/3 in Mix.Task.run_task/4
    (mix 1.14.2) lib/mix/cli.ex:84: Mix.CLI.run_task/2
```

You can resolve this error by installing the Rust compiler using Homebrew. Run
the following command in your terminal: `brew install rust`

If you have already compiled Rambo explicitly via `mix compile.rambo`, and you
are still seeing the following error:

```
sh: /path_to_directory/Lightning/_build/dev/lib/rambo/priv/rambo: No such file or directory
sh: line 0: exec: /path_to_directory/Lightning/_build/dev/lib/rambo/priv/rambo: cannot execute: No such file or directory
```

You can try renaming `deps/rambo/priv/rambo-mac` to `deps/rambo/priv/rambo`.

If neither of the approaches above work, please raise an issue.
