/**
 * Priority levels for key handlers.
 *
 * This enumeration defines priority levels for keybinding handlers, allowing the application
 * to resolve conflicts when multiple handlers match the same key combination. Handlers with
 * a higher priority value will take precedence over those with lower priority values.
 *
 * ### Values:
 * - `HIGH` (1): Indicates that the handler has a high priority. Handlers with this priority
 *   will take precedence over those with `NORMAL` priority in cases of conflict.
 * - `NORMAL` (0): Indicates that the handler has a normal priority. This is the default
 *   priority for handlers unless specified otherwise.
 *
 * ### Why Priority Levels Are Important:
 * 1. **Conflict Resolution:**
 *    When multiple handlers match the same key combination, the system uses the `priority`
 *    value to determine which handler should execute. This ensures predictable behavior
 *    in cases where keybindings overlap.
 *
 * 2. **Fine-Grained Control:**
 *    Developers can assign priority levels to handlers to explicitly control their
 *    execution order. For example, a high-priority handler can override global handlers
 *    within a specific context.
 *
 * 3. **Readability and Maintainability:**
 *    Using named constants (`HIGH`, `NORMAL`) instead of raw numbers improves code
 *    readability and reduces the likelihood of errors.
 *
 * ### Example Usage:
 * ```typescript
 * const handler1 = createKeyCombinationHook(
 *   isCtrlOrMetaS,
 *   submitAction,
 *   PRIORITY.HIGH // High priority, overrides normal handlers
 * );
 *
 * const handler2 = createKeyCombinationHook(
 *   isEscape,
 *   closeAction,
 *   PRIORITY.NORMAL // Normal priority, default level
 * );
 * ```
 */
enum PRIORITY {
  HIGH = 1,
  NORMAL = 0,
}

/**
 * Alias type for priority levels, ensuring strict typing and consistency.
 *
 * This type ensures that only valid priority values defined in the `PRIORITY` enum
 * can be used in keybinding handlers, preventing accidental use of unsupported values.
 */
type PriorityLevel = PRIORITY;

/**
 * Global registry to track all active key handlers.
 *
 * This `Set` serves as the core mechanism for managing all keybinding handlers in a given page of the app.
 * It ensures that keybinding logic is centralized, making it easier to manage, resolve conflicts, and maintain consistency.
 *
 * ### Structure of a Handler:
 * Each handler is an object with the following properties:
 * - `hook`: The `PhoenixHook` instance where the handler is defined. This provides context for lifecycle management and ensures handlers are correctly removed when hooks are unmounted.
 * - `keyCheck`: A function that determines whether a given `KeyboardEvent` matches the key combination for the handler. This allows flexible and precise matching of keybindings.
 * - `action`: A function that executes when the key combination matches. It receives the `KeyboardEvent` and the associated DOM element (`el`) from the `hook`.
 * - `priority`: A `PriorityLevel` value (e.g., `PRIORITY.HIGH` or `PRIORITY.NORMAL`) used to resolve conflicts when multiple handlers match the same key combination. Handlers with higher priority take precedence.
 * - `bindingScope`: (Optional) A string representing the scope (defined via the `data-keybinding-scope` attribute in the DOM) where the handler should apply. This ensures that keybindings can be context-aware and prevents unintended execution in irrelevant parts of the application.
 *
 * ### Example Usage:
 * ```typescript
 * keyHandlers.add({
 *   hook: this,
 *   keyCheck: (e) => e.ctrlKey && e.key === 's',
 *   action: (e, el) => console.log("Ctrl+S pressed"),
 *   priority: PRIORITY.NORMAL,
 *   bindingScope: 'editor'
 * });
 * ```

/**
 * Creates a PhoenixHook to listen for specific key combinations and trigger defined actions.
 *
 * This function is used to bind a key combination to a specific action with optional priority and scope.
 * It supports scoped key bindings using the `data-keybinding-scope` attribute and resolves conflicts
 * between overlapping handlers by priority.
 *
 * Example:
 * ```typescript
 * const hook = createKeyCombinationHook(
 *   (e) => e.ctrlKey && e.key === "s",
 *   (e, el) => console.log("Ctrl+S pressed!", el),
 *   PRIORITY.HIGH,
 *   "example-scope"
 * );
 * ```
 *
 * @param keyCheck - A function that determines whether the current key combination matches.
 *                   It should return `true` for matching key events and `false` otherwise.
 * @param action - A function to execute when the key combination is triggered.
 *                 This function receives the `KeyboardEvent` and the hook's associated DOM element (`el`).
 * @param priority - (Optional) The priority of the handler. Higher-priority handlers are executed first.
 *                   Defaults to `PRIORITY.NORMAL`.
 * @param bindingScope - (Optional) A string representing the scope of the handler.
 *                       Handlers with a `bindingScope` only execute within elements with a matching `data-keybinding-scope`.
 *                       Defaults to `undefined`, making the handler global.
 * @returns A PhoenixHook object that manages the keybinding lifecycle.
