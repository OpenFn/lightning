# Provisioning

Lightning offers the ability to configure projects via the HTTP API.

By providing a JSON document with the desired configuration, the project can be
configured to your liking.

## Using the API

The API is available at `/api/provision`, and expects an `application/json`
Content-Type.

### Authentication

The API requires a valid auth token to be provided in the `Authorization`
header.

### Example Request

```bash
 curl -X POST \
   -d @project.json \
   -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
   -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
   $ENDPOINT/api/provision
```

## Document Structure

The provisioning document is a JSON document with the project at the root.

> All entities **must have** an `id` field, which is a UUIDv4 string. In the
> case of new entities, this must be generated by the client.

```jsonc
{
  "id": "<<project-id>>",
  "name": "<<project-name>>",
  "workflows": [
    {
      "id": "<<workflow-id>>",
      "name": "<<workflow-name>>",
      "jobs": [
        {
          "id": "<<job-id>>",
          "name": "<<job-name>>",
          "body": "<<job-body>>",
          "adaptor": "<<adaptor-name>>",
          "enabled": true
        }
        // ... more jobs
      ],
      "triggers": [
        {
          "id": "<<trigger-id>>",
          "name": "<<trigger-name>>",
          "type": "webhook"
        }
        // ... more triggers
      ],
      "edges": [
        {
          "id": "<<edge-id>>",
          "source_trigger_id": "<<trigger-id>>",
          "target_job_id": "<<job-id>>"
        }
        // ... more edges
      ]
    }
    // ... more workflows
  ]
}
```

## API Behaviour

The API expects **all** existing entities to be provided in the provisioning
document.

If the document provided is out of date (e.g. a new job was added on the
server), a new reference document should be fetched and the changes applied to
it.

### Deleting Entities

Entities can be deleted by setting the `delete` key to `true`.

Example:

```jsonc
{
  "id": "<<project-id>>",
  "workflows": [
    {
      "id": "<<workflow-id>>",
      "jobs": [
        {
          "id": "<<job-id>>",
          "delete": true // <== delete this job
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

## Relationship with Projects as Code

The Projects as Code spec is a superset of the provisioning API.

Projects as Code allows for the user to specify a key for each entity, which
makes it easier to manage the project in the future.

For example:

```yaml
name: my-project
workflows:
  workflow-one:
    jobs:
      job-one:
        body: |
          console.log("Hello World");
        adaptor: '@openfn/language-common'
        enabled: true
    triggers:
      trigger-one:
        type: webhook
    edges:
      - source_trigger: trigger-one
        target_job: job-one
```

The above YAML document illustrates the use of keys being used to identify
entities. Allowing the user to provision the same project to multiple
environments.

The API is unaware of 'keys', and expects IDs to be provided by the client.

In order to convert the above YAML document to a provisioning document, the CLI
uses a local state file (if available) to map the keys to UUIDs.

Using the example above a state file might look like this:

```jsonc
{
  "id": "f6ba9a8c-b687-473a-908e-e250686f1eed",
  "workflows": {
    "workflow-one": {
      "id": "f206aa85-4fce-492e-94eb-ffd32c75d178",
      "jobs": {},
      "triggers": {}
    }
  }
}
```

The state file shows that the project and workflow already exist, but the job,
trigger and edge do not. In order to create these new entities, IDs will be
applied them.

On a successful application of the provisioning document, the state file will be
updated to reflect the new IDs and entities.

```json
{
  "id": "f6ba9a8c-b687-473a-908e-e250686f1eed",
  "workflows": {
    "workflow-one": {
      "id": "f206aa85-4fce-492e-94eb-ffd32c75d178",
      "jobs": {
        "job-one": { "id": "18ed71de-caf8-4822-aefc-5b19351f4016" }
      },
      "triggers": {
        "trigger-one": { "id": "e0b9f357-9cf9-4206-9924-4d5674aad830" }
      },
      "edges": [
        {
          "id": "c239d994-6662-4637-90f8-0293c924b461",
          "source_trigger_id": "e0b9f357-9cf9-4206-9924-4d5674aad830",
          "target_job_id": "18ed71de-caf8-4822-aefc-5b19351f4016"
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```
