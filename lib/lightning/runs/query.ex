  Applies concurrency window functions to workflow-limited run data.

  This function takes the output from `workflow_limited_runs/1` and applies
  SQL window functions to calculate row numbers within concurrency partitions.

  ## Partitioning Logic

  Runs are partitioned (grouped) by workflow or project for row numbering.
  Workflow concurrency takes precedence over project concurrency when both are set.
  Within each partition, runs are ordered by priority and insertion time.

  ## Return Fields

  Returns a query that selects:
  - `id` - the run ID
  - `state` - the current state of the run
  - `row_number` - sequential number within the concurrency partition
  - `project_id` - the project ID
  - `concurrency` - the maximum concurrent runs allowed (workflow or project level)
  - `inserted_at` - when the run was created
  - `priority` - the run's priority level

  The `row_number` field is used downstream to enforce concurrency limits by
  comparing it against the `concurrency` value.

  Query to return runs that are eligible for claiming.

  This is the main function used by other parts of the system to get runs ready
  for execution. It implements a performance-optimized approach to run claiming
  that ensures fairness across workflows while respecting concurrency limits.

  ## Algorithm

  1. **Workflow Limiting**: Limits the number of runs per workflow to prevent any
     single workflow from dominating the processing queue
  2. **Window Processing**: Applies row numbering within concurrency partitions
     (workflow or project level) on the workflow-limited dataset
  3. **Concurrency Enforcement**: Uses the row numbers to enforce concurrency
     limits during run claiming
  4. **Availability Filtering**: Filters for available runs within concurrency limits
  5. **Priority Ordering**: Orders results by priority and insertion time

  ## Implementation

  The function uses a multi-step approach for performance optimization:

  1. **Pre-filtering**: Uses `workflow_limited_runs/1` to limit runs per workflow
     (configurable via `:per_workflow_claim_limit`) preventing any single workflow
     from dominating the claim queue while ensuring fairness
  2. **Window Functions**: Applies `in_progress_window/0` to calculate row numbers
     within concurrency partitions on the smaller, pre-filtered dataset
  3. **Final Filtering**: Selects only available runs that fall within their
     concurrency limits (where `row_number <= concurrency`)

  ## Concurrency Logic

  Workflow concurrency takes precedence over project concurrency when both are set.
  This ensures that workflow-level limits are respected first, with project-level
  limits serving as a fallback.

  ## Performance Notes

  The dataset is first limited per workflow (default: 50 runs) to manage the size
  of data processed by expensive window functions, significantly improving query
  performance on large datasets.

  > ### Note {: .info}
  > The default `:per_workflow_claim_limit` is 50.
  > This can be configured via the `PER_WORKFLOW_CLAIM_LIMIT` environment variable.
  > The value must be larger than the max concurrency of any individual workflow.

  Returns runs ordered by priority and insertion time that can be safely claimed
  without violating concurrency limits.
