  authorize/3 takes an action, a user, and a project. It checks the user's role
  for this project and returns `true` if the user can perform the action in
  that project and `false` if they cannot.

  Note that permissions are grouped by action, rather than by user role.

  We deny by default, so if a user's role is not added to the allow roles list
  for a particular action they are denied.
