  Finds and assigns a project to the socket, if a user doesn't have access
  they are redirected and shown a 'No Access' screen via a `:nav` flash message.

  There is a fallthru function, when there is no `project_id` in the params -
  this is for liveviews that may or may not have a `project_id` depending on
  usage - like `DashboardLive`.
