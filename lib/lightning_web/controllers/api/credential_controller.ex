defmodule LightningWeb.API.CredentialController do
  @moduledoc """
  API controller for credential management.

  Handles creation, retrieval, and deletion of credentials. Credentials are
  used to authenticate with external services and can be associated with
  multiple projects.

  ## Security

  - Credential bodies are excluded from responses for security
  - Users can only delete credentials they own
  - Project access is required to view project credentials

  ## Examples

      GET /api/credentials
      GET /api/credentials?project_id=a1b2c3d4-...
      POST /api/credentials
      DELETE /api/credentials/a1b2c3d4-...

  Lists credentials with optional project filtering.

  This function has two variants:
  - With `project_id`: Returns all credentials for a specific project (regardless of owner)
  - Without `project_id`: Returns only credentials owned by the authenticated user

  Credential bodies are excluded from responses for security.

  ## Parameters

  - `conn` - The Plug connection struct with the current resource assigned
  - `params` - Map containing:
    - `project_id` - Project UUID (optional, filters to specific project)

  ## Returns

  - `200 OK` with list of credentials (bodies excluded)
  - `404 Not Found` if project doesn't exist (when project_id provided)
  - `403 Forbidden` if user lacks project access (when project_id provided)

  ## Examples

      # User's own credentials
      GET /api/credentials

      # All credentials for a project
      GET /api/credentials?project_id=a1b2c3d4-5e6f-7a8b-9c0d-1e2f3a4b5c6d

  Creates a new credential and optionally grants it access to projects.

  Creates a credential owned by the authenticated user. If project_credentials
  are specified, the user must have access to all listed projects. The credential
  body is included in the response only upon creation.

  ## Parameters

  - `conn` - The Plug connection struct with the current resource assigned
  - `params` - Map containing:
    - `name` - Credential name (required)
    - `body` - Credential JSON body with authentication details (required)
    - `project_credentials` - List of project associations (optional)

  ## Returns

  - `201 Created` with credential JSON including body
  - `422 Unprocessable Entity` on validation errors
  - `403 Forbidden` if user lacks access to specified projects

  ## Examples

      # Create credential without project association
      POST /api/credentials

  Deletes a credential owned by the authenticated user.

  Permanently removes a credential. Only the credential owner can delete it.

  ## Returns

  - `204 No Content` on successful deletion
  - `404 Not Found` if credential doesn't exist or invalid UUID
