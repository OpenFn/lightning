# Config.CSRF for authenticated_json pipeline (router.ex:50):
# This pipeline is only used for JSON API endpoints (GET /api/ai_assistant/sessions)
# that use session-based auth. CSRF protection is not needed because:
# 1. GET requests don't modify state
# 2. JSON APIs are protected by browser same-origin policy
# 3. The browser pipeline (which handles forms) has protect_from_forgery
