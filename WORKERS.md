# Workers

The OpenFn Runtime used by Lightning is a [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
application that runs on a server. It is responsible for executing the code that
you write in your OpenFn jobs.

A Runtime Manager is a module or application that processes Attempts, which
contains reference to the Workflow, the starting point and the initial data.

Attempts are enqueued, and Runtime Managers request work to be performed when
they are ready.

## History

In previous versions of OpenFn products, the server would invoke a NodeJS child
process for each Run that needs to be executed. Deciding which Job to run in a
workflow is decided after each run is completed.

The current approach to executing Attempts, is that a worker checks out the
entire attempt and executes it and all the jobs required.

The advantage of this approach is a significant reduction in latency of
launching new workers for every Run to be processed.

## Connecting Workers to Lightning

Our standard Runtime Manager uses WebSockets to communicate with Lightning.

However, since the workers are treated no differently from any other incoming
traffic; there are two layers of security applied to anything that can access
your data or process work.

We use two different JWTs to facilitate the follow:

### Worker Token

This token is created by the worker and signed with a shared HS256 secret that
Lightning uses to verify.

### Attempt Token

This token is created by Lightning for every Attempt that a worker receives. The
token is signed with a private key, and therefore cannot be generated by 3rd
parties.

The token is scoped for a single Attempt and cannot be used to access anything
outside of the scope of that Attempt.

## Generating Keys

Lightning comes with a mix task to help generate keys:

```
mix lightning.gen_worker_keys
```

## Configuring Lightning and Workers

There are three environment variables required to make everthing work.

**`ATTEMPTS_PRIVATE_KEY`**

_Lightning only_

A Base64 encoded private key in PEM format, used to generate JWTs granting
workers permission to access a specific Attempt, the related Workflow and
credentials.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This key should never be shared. If you suspect it has been compromised, 
> generate a new one and reconfigure both Lightning and your workers.

**`WORKER_SECRET`**

_Lightning and Workers_

A 256bit long shared secret used by the worker to sign JWTs for authentication
with the Lightning API.

**`LIGHTNING_PUBLIC_KEY`**

_Workers only_

A Base64 encoded public key in PEM format derived from the private key.
This is used by workers to verify Attempt Tokens coming from Lightning.
