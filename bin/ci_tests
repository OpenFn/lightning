#
# Purpose: Run and retry Elixir tests with coverage and generate JUnit XML
# reports for CI environments.
#
# Rationale:
#
# This script runs the main test suite and generates a JUnit XML report for
# CI systems to consume.
# If the test run fails with exit code 2 (indicating some tests failed), it
# reruns only the failed tests and generates a separate JUnit XML report for
# those.
# The script renames the reports to -all.xml (for the main run) and -failed.xml
# (for the failed tests rerun) to avoid overwriting and to make CI artifacts
# clear.
# We use 'set +e' and 'set -e' around the test command to capture its exit
# code without the script exiting immediately, so we can handle retries and
# reporting logic robustly.
# Coverage from the first coveralls run is merged into the second (using
# --import-cover), so that the final coverage report reflects both the main
# and failed test runs.
# This approach ensures that CI systems get both a full and a failed-only
# test report, and that the script exits with the correct status for
# downstream steps.
