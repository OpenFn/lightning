On startup, it queries the filesystem for package.json files and builds up a list of available adaptors. Configuration The service requires at least :adaptors_path , which is used to both query which adaptors are installed and when to install new adaptors. Another optional setting is: :repo , which must point at a module that will be used to do the querying and installing. Installing Adaptors Using the install/2 function an adaptor can be installed, which will also add it to the list of available adaptors. The adaptor is marked as :installing , to allow for conditional behaviour elsewhere such as delaying or rejecting processing until the adaptor becomes available. Looking up adaptors The module leans on Elixir's built-in Version module to provide version lookups. When looking up an adaptor, either a string or a tuple can be used. In the case of requesting the latest version, any one of these will return the latest version the service is aware of. @openfn/language-http @openfn/language-http@latest {&quot;@openfn/language-http&quot;, nil} {&quot;@openfn/language-http&quot;, &quot;latest&quot;} {~r/language-http/, &quot;latest&quot;} You can also request a specific version, or use a range specification: @openfn/language-http@1.2.3 {&quot;@openfn/language-http&quot;, &quot;~&gt; 1.2.0&quot;} {&quot;@openfn/language-http&quot;, &quot;&lt; 2.0.0&quot;} NOTE More complex npm style install strings like: &quot;&gt;=0.1.0 &lt;0.2.0&quot; are not supported.

You're contributing to a digital public good that will always be free and open source and aimed at serving innovative NGOs, governments, and social impact organizations the world over! You rock. ❤️ FYI, Lightning is built in Elixir , harnessing the Phoenix Framework . Currently, the only unbundled dependency is a PostgreSQL database. Set up your environment If you have push access to this repository (are you an authorized maintainer?) then you'll be able to make changes and push them to a feature branch before submitting a pull request. If you're new to OpenFn, you'll need to make a fork and push your changes there. Once you're ready to submit a pull request, you can click the &quot;compare across forks&quot; link on GitHub's pull request interface and then open one for review. Clone the repo and optionally set ENVs git clone git@github.com:OpenFn/Lightning.git # or from YOUR fork! cd Lightning cp .env.example .env # and adjust as necessary! Take note of database names and ports in particular—they've got to match across your Postgres setup and your ENVs. You can run lightning without any ENVs assuming a vanilla postgres setup (see below), but you may want to make adjustments. Database Setup If you're already using Postgres locally, create a new database called lightning_dev , for example. If you'd rather use Docker to set up a Postgres DB, create a new volume and image: docker volume create lightning-postgres-data docker create \\ --name lightning-postgres \\ --mount source=lightning-postgres-data,target=/var/lib/postgresql/data \\ --publish 5432:5432 \\ -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=postgres \\ postgres:14.1-alpine docker start lightning-postgres Elixir &amp; Ecto Setup We use asdf to configure our local environments. Included in the repo is a .tool-versions file that is read by asdf in order to dynamically make the specified versions of Elixir and Erlang available. You'll need asdf plugins for Erlang , NodeJs , and Elixir . asdf install # Install language versions mix local.hex mix deps.get mix local.rebar --force mix ecto.create # Create a development database in Postgres mix ecto.migrate mix lightning.install_runtime mix lightning.install_schemas npm install --prefix assets Run the app Lightning is a web app. To run it in interactive Elixir mode, start the development server by running with your environment variables by running: iex -S mix phx.server or if you have set up custom environment variables, run: env $(cat .env | grep -v &quot;#&quot; | xargs ) iex -S mix phx.server Once the server has started, head to localhost:4000 in your browser. Run the tests Before the first time running the tests, you need a test database setup. MIX_ENV=test mix ecto.create And then after that run the tests using: MIX_ENV=test mix test We also have test.watch installed which can be used to rerun the tests on file changes. Security and Standards We use a host of common Elixir static analysis tools to help us avoid common pitfalls and make sure we keep everything clean and consistent. In addition to our test suite, you can run the following commands: mix format --check-formatted Code formatting checker, run again without the --check-formatted flag to have your code automatically changed. mix dialyzer Static analysis for type mismatches and other common warnings. See dialyxir . mix credo Static analysis for consistency, and coding standards. See Credo . mix sobelow Check for commonly known security exploits. See Sobelow . MIX_ENV=test mix coveralls Test coverage reporter. This command also runs the test suite, and can be used in place of mix test when checking everything before pushing your code. See excoveralls . For convenience there is a verify mix task that runs all of the above and defaults the MIX_ENV to test . Generating Documentation You can generate the HTML and EPUB documentation locally using: mix docs and opening doc/index.html in your browser.","ref":"readme.html#contribute-to-this-project","title":"Lightning - Contribute to this project","type":"extras"},{"doc":"Trouble with environment variables For troubleshooting custom environment variable configuration it's important to know how an Elixir app loads and modifies configuration. The order is as follows: Stuff in config.exs is loaded. That is then modified (think: overwritten ) by stuff your ENV-specific config: dev.exs , prod.exs or test.exs . That is then modified by runtime.exs which is where you are allowed to use System.env() Finally init/2 (if present in a child application) gets called (which takes the config which has been set in steps 1-3) when that child application is started during the parent app startup defined in application.ex . Problems with Postgres If you're having connecting issues with Postgres, check the database section of your .env to ensure the DB url is correctly set for your environment — note that composing a DB url out of other, earlier declared variables, does not work while using xargs .
