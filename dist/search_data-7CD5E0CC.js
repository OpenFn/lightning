In that folder you can find 3 files:\n- The `users.ex` file has all the policies for the instances wide access levels\n- The `project_users.ex` file has all the policies for the project wide access levels\n- The `permissions.ex` file defines the `Lightning.Policies.Permissions.can/4` interface. Which is a wrapper around the `Bodyguard.permit/4` function.\nWe use that interface to be able to harmonize the use of policies accross the entire app.\n\nAll the policies are tested in the `test/lightning/policies` folder. And the test are written in a way that allows the reader to quickly who can do what in the app.\n\nWe have two variants of the `Lightning.Policies.Permissions.can/4` interface:\n- `Lightning.Policies.Permissions.can(policy, action, actor, resource)` returns `:ok` if the actor can perform the action on the resource and `{:error, :unauthorized}` otherwise.\n- `Lightning.Policies.Permissions.can?(policy, action, actor, resource)` returns `true` if the actor can perform the action on the resource and `false` otherwise.\n\nHere is an example of how we the `Lightning.Policies.Permissions.can/4` interface to check if the a user can edit a job or not\n```elixir\ncan_edit_job = Lightning.Policies.ProjectUsers |> Lightning.Policies.Permissions.can?(:edit_job, socket.assigns.current_user, socket.assigns.project)\n\nif can_edit_job do\n  # allow user to edit the job\nelse\n  # quick user out\nend\n```","ref":"Lightning.Policies.Permissions.html"},{"type":"function","title":"Lightning.Policies.Permissions.can/4","doc":"checks if user has the permissions to apply action using some policy module\n\nReturns `:ok` if user can apply action and `{:error, :unauthorized}` otherwise","ref":"Lightning.Policies.Permissions.html#can/4"},{"type":"function","title":"Examples - Lightning.Policies.Permissions.can/4","doc":"iex> can(Lightning.Policies.Users, :create_workflow, user, project)\n    :ok\n\n    iex> can(Lightning.Policies.Users, :create_project, user, %{})\n    {:error, :unauthorized}","ref":"Lightning.Policies.Permissions.html#can/4-examples"},{"type":"function","title":"Lightning.Policies.Permissions.can?/4","doc":"same as can/4 but returns `true` if user can apply action and `false` otherwise","ref":"Lightning.Policies.Permissions.html#can?/4"},{"type":"function","title":"Examples - Lightning.Policies.Permissions.can?/4","doc":"iex> can(Lightning.Policies.Users, :create_workflow, user, project)\n    true\n\n    iex> can(Lightning.Policies.Users, :create_project, user, %{})\n    false","ref":"Lightning.Policies.Permissions.html#can?/4-examples"},{"type":"module","title":"Lightning.Policies.ProjectUsers","doc":"The Bodyguard Policy module for projects members roles.","ref":"Lightning.Policies.ProjectUsers.html"},{"type":"function","title":"Lightning.Policies.ProjectUsers.authorize/3","doc":"authorize/3 takes an action, a user, and a project.

This created inefficiencies and security\nvulnerabilities. Now, the Lightning web server adds attempts to a queue and\nmultiple worker applications can pull from that queue to process work.\n\nIn dev mode, this all happens automatically and on one machine, but in most\nhigh-availability production environments the workers will be on another server.\n\nAttempts are now handled entirely by the workers, and they report back to\nLightning. Exit reasons, final attempt states, error types and error messages\nare either entirely new or handled differently now, but we have provided\nmigration scripts that will work to bring _most_ `v0.9.3` runs, attempts, and\nworkorders up to `v0.10.0`, though the granularity of `v0.9.3` states and exits\nwill be less than `v0.10.0` and the final states are not guaranteed to be\naccurate for workflows with multiple branches and leaf nodes with varying exit\nreasons.\n\nThe migration scripts can be run with a single function call in SetupUtils from\na connect `iex` session:\n\n```\nLightning.SetupUtils.approximate_state_for_attempts_and_workorders()\n```\n\nNote that (like lots of _other_ functionality in `SetupUtils`, calling this\nfunction is a destructive action and you should only do it if you've backed up\nyour data and you know what you're doing.)\n\nAs always, we recommend backing up your data before migrating.
