Data is returned in a {text, page_number} format where text is intended to be the text of the link and page_number is the page it should go to. Defaults are already supplied and they are as follows: [ distance : 5 , next : :next , previous : :previous , first : true , last : true , ellipsis : :ellipsis ] distance must be a positive non-zero integer or an exception is raised. next and previous should be strings but can be anything you want as long as it is truthy, falsey values will remove them from the output. first and last are only booleans, and they just include/remove their respective link from output. An example of the data returned: iex&gt; Scrivener.HTML . raw_pagination_links ( %{ total_pages : 10 , page_number : 5 } ) [ { &quot;&lt;&lt;&quot; , 4 } , { 1 , 1 } , { 2 , 2 } , { 3 , 3 } , { 4 , 4 } , { 5 , 5 } , { 6 , 6 } , { 7 , 7 } , { 8 , 8 } , { 9 , 9 } , { 10 , 10 } , { &quot;&gt;&gt;&quot; , 6 } ] iex&gt; Scrivener.HTML . raw_pagination_links ( %{ total_pages : 20 , page_number : 10 } , first : [ &quot;←&quot; ] , last : [ &quot;→&quot; ] ) [ { &quot;&lt;&lt;&quot; , 9 } , { [ &quot;←&quot; ] , 1 } , { :ellipsis , { :safe , &quot;&amp;hellip;&quot; } } , { 5 , 5 } , { 6 , 6 } , { 7 , 7 } , { 8 , 8 } , { 9 , 9 } , { 10 , 10 } , { 11 , 11 } , { 12 , 12 } , { 13 , 13 } , { 14 , 14 } , { 15 , 15 } , { :ellipsis , { :safe , &quot;&amp;hellip;&quot; } } , { [ &quot;→&quot; ] , 20 } , { &quot;&gt;&gt;&quot; , 11 } ] Simply loop and pattern match over each item and transform it to your custom HTML.","ref":"LightningWeb.Pagination.html#raw_pagination_links/2","title":"LightningWeb.Pagination.raw_pagination_links/2","type":"function"},{"doc":"Plug to redirect HTTP requests to /first_setup if there are no superusers in the system yet.","ref":"LightningWeb.Plugs.FirstSetup.html","title":"LightningWeb.Plugs.FirstSetup","type":"module"},{"doc":"LiveView for user profile page.","ref":"LightningWeb.ProfileLive.Edit.html","title":"LightningWeb.ProfileLive.Edit","type":"module"},{"doc":"Callback implementation for Phoenix.LiveView.render/1 .","ref":"LightningWeb.ProfileLive.Edit.html#render/1","title":"LightningWeb.ProfileLive.Edit.render/1","type":"function"},{"doc":"Form component update profile email and password","ref":"LightningWeb.ProfileLive.FormComponent.html","title":"LightningWeb.ProfileLive.FormComponent","type":"module"},{"doc":"Callback implementation for Phoenix.LiveComponent.render/1 .","ref":"LightningWeb.ProfileLive.FormComponent.html#render/1","title":"LightningWeb.ProfileLive.FormComponent.render/1","type":"function"},{"doc":"Form Component for working with a single Job A Job's adaptor field is a combination of the module name and the version.

You're contributing to a digital public good that will always be free and open source and aimed at serving innovative NGOs, governments, and social impact organizations the world over! You rock. ❤️ FYI, Lightning is built in Elixir , harnessing the Phoenix Framework . Currently, the only unbundled dependency is a PostgreSQL database. Set up your environment If you have push access to this repository (are you an authorized maintainer?) then you'll be able to make changes and push them to a feature branch before submitting a pull request. If you're new to OpenFn, you'll need to make a fork and push your changes there. Once you're ready to submit a pull request, you can click the &quot;compare across forks&quot; link on GitHub's pull request interface and then open one for review. Clone the repo and set ENVs git clone git@github.com:OpenFn/Lightning.git # or from YOUR fork! cd Lightning cp .env.example .env # and adjust as necessary! Take note of database names and ports in particular—they've got to match across your Postgres setup and your ENVs. Database Setup If you're already using Postgres locally, create a new database called lightning_dev , for example. If you'd rather use Docker to set up a Postgres DB, create a new volume and image: docker volume create lightning-postgres-data docker create \\ --name lightning-postgres \\ --mount source=lightning-postgres-data,target=/var/lib/postgresql/data \\ --publish 5432:5432 \\ -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=postgres \\ postgres:14.1-alpine docker start lightning-postgres Elixir &amp; Ecto Setup We use asdf to configure our local environments. Included in the repo is a .tool-versions file that is read by asdf in order to dynamically make the specified versions of Elixir and Erlang available. asdf install # Install language versions mix local.hex mix deps.get mix local.rebar --force mix ecto.create # Create a development database in Postgres mix ecto.migrate mix openfn.install.runtime npm install --prefix assets Run the app Lightning is a web app. To run it in interactive Elixir mode, start the development server by running with your environment variables by running: env $(cat .env | grep -v &quot;#&quot; | xargs ) iex -S mix phx.server Once the server has started, head to localhost:4000 in your browser. Run the tests Before the first time running the tests, you need a test database setup. MIX_ENV=test mix ecto.create And then after that run the tests using: MIX_ENV=test mix test We also have test.watch installed which can be used to rerun the tests on file changes. Security and Standards We use a host of common Elixir static analysis tools to help us avoid common pitfalls and make sure we keep everything clean and consistent. In addition to our test suite, you can run the following commands: mix format --check-formatted Code formatting checker, run again without the --check-formatted flag to have your code automatically changed. mix dialyzer Static analysis for type mismatches and other common warnings. See dialyxir . mix credo Static analysis for consistency, and coding standards. See Credo . mix sobelow Check for commonly known security exploits. See Sobelow . MIX_ENV=test mix coveralls Test coverage reporter. This command also runs the test suite, and can be used in place of mix test when checking everything before pushing your code. See excoveralls . For convenience there is a verify mix task that runs all of the above and defaults the MIX_ENV to test .
