### Added

- Allow administrators to configure OIDC providers for authentication (note that

### Added

- Transfer credential ownership to another user.
- Create credentials via a form interface\*
- Show "projects with access" in credentials list view.
- Show job in runs list and run view.

\*The form is defined by a JSON schema provided by an adaptor, in most cases:
e.g., `language-dhis2` provides a single schema which defines the required
attributes for `state.configuration`, while `language-common` provides multiple
credential schemas like "oauth" or "basic auth" which define attributes for
`state.configuration` and which might be used by lots of different jobs.)

- User profile screen integrated with the rest of the liveview app.
