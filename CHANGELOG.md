## [Unreleased]

### ðŸš¨ Breaking change warning! ðŸš¨

This release will contain breaking changes as we've significantly improved both
the workflow building and execution systems.

#### Nodes and edges

Before, workflows were represented as a list of jobs and triggers. For greater
flexibility and control of complex workflows, we've moved towards a more robust
"nodes and edges" approach. Where jobs in a workflow (a node) can be connected
by edges.

Triggers still exist, but live "outside" the directed acyclic graph (DAG) and
are used to automatically create workorders and attempts.

We've provided migrations that bring `v0.9.3` workflows in line with the
`v0.10.0` requirements.

#### Scalable workers

Before, Lightning spawned child processes to execute attempts in sand-boxed
NodeVMs on the same server. This created inefficiencies and security
vulnerabilities. Now, the Lightning web server adds attempts to a queue and
multiple worker applications can pull from that queue to process work.

In dev mode, this all happens automatically and on one machine, but in most
high-availability production environments the workers will be on another server.

Attempts are now handled entirely by the workers, and they report back to
Lightning. Exit reasons, final attempt states, error types and error messages
are either entirely new or handled differently now, but we have provided
migration scripts that will work to bring _most_ `v0.9.3` runs, attempts, and
workorders up to `v0.10.0`, though the granularity of `v0.9.3` states and exits
will be less than `v0.10.0` and the final states are not guaranteed to be
accurate for workflows with multiple branches and leaf nodes with varying exit
reasons.

The migration scripts can be run with a single function call in SetupUtils from
a connect `iex` session:

```
Lightning.SetupUtils.approximate_state_for_attempts_and_workorders()
```

Note that (like lots of _other_ functionality in `SetupUtils`, calling this
function is a destructive action and you should only do it if you've backed up
your data and you know what you're doing.)

As always, we recommend backing up your data before migrating. (And thanks for
bearing with us as we move towards our first stable Lightning release.)

- Add filtered search params to the history page URL
  [#660](https://github.com/OpenFn/Lightning/issues/660)

  [774](https://github.com/OpenFn/Lightning/issues/774)

## [0.5.0] - 2023-04-03

### Added

- Magic functions that fetch real metadata from connected systems via
  `credentials` and suggest completions in the job builder (e.g., pressing
  `control-space` when setting the `orgUnit` attribute for a DHIS2 create
  operation will pull the _actual_ list of orgUnits with human readable labels
  and fill in their orgUnit codes upon
  enter.)[670](https://github.com/OpenFn/Lightning/issues/670)
- A "metadata explorer" to browse actual system metadata for connected
  instances. [658](https://github.com/OpenFn/Lightning/issues/658)

  [#716](https://github.com/OpenFn/Lightning/issues/716)
- Instance administrators can now configure the interval between when a project
  owner or user requests deletion and when these records are purged from the
  database. It defaults to 7, but by providing a `PURGE_DELETED_AFTER_DAYS`
  environment variable the grace period can be altered. Note that setting this
  variable to `0` will make automatic purging _never_ occur but will still make
  "deleted" projects and users unavailable. This has been requested by certain
  organizations that must retain audit logs in a Lightning instance.
  [758](https://github.com/OpenFn/Lightning/issues/758)

### Fixed

- Locked CLI version to `@openfn/cli@0.0.35`.

### Added

- Added a test harness for monitoring critical parts of the app using Telemetry
  [#654](https://github.com/OpenFn/Lightning/issues/654)

  the CLI, but not for Lightning. In the future the log level will be
  configurable at instance > project > job level by the `superuser` and any
  project `admin`.
- Renamed license file so that automagic github icon is less confusing

### Fixed

- Broken links in failure alert email
  [#732](https://github.com/OpenFn/Lightning/issues/732)

\*The form is defined by a JSON schema provided by an adaptor, in most cases:
e.g., `language-dhis2` provides a single schema which defines the required
attributes for `state.configuration`, while `language-common` provides multiple
credential schemas like "oauth" or "basic auth" which define attributes for
`state.configuration` and which might be used by lots of different jobs.)
