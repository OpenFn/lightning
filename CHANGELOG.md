## [0.5.0] - 2023-04-03

### Added

- Magic functions that fetch real metadata from connected systems via
  `credentials` and suggest completions in the job builder (e.g., pressing
  `control-space` when setting the `orgUnit` attribute for a DHIS2 create
  operation will pull the _actual_ list of orgUnits with human readable labels
  and fill in their orgUnit codes upon
  enter.)[670](https://github.com/OpenFn/Lightning/issues/670)
- A "metadata explorer" to browse actual system metadata for connected
  instances. [658](https://github.com/OpenFn/Lightning/issues/658)

  [#716](https://github.com/OpenFn/Lightning/issues/716)
- Instance administrators can now configure the interval between when a project
  owner or user requests deletion and when these records are purged from the
  database. It defaults to 7, but by providing a `PURGE_DELETED_AFTER_DAYS`
  environment variable the grace period can be altered. Note that setting this
  variable to `0` will make automatic purging _never_ occur but will still make
  "deleted" projects and users unavailable. This has been requested by certain
  organizations that must retain audit logs in a Lightning instance.
  [758](https://github.com/OpenFn/Lightning/issues/758)

### Fixed

- Locked CLI version to `@openfn/cli@0.0.35`.

  the CLI, but not for Lightning. In the future the log level will be
  configurable at instance > project > job level by the `superuser` and any
  project `admin`.
- Renamed license file so that automagic github icon is less confusing

### Fixed

- Broken links in failure alert email
  [#732](https://github.com/OpenFn/Lightning/issues/732)

  browser [#686](https://github.com/OpenFn/Lightning/issues/686)

\*The form is defined by a JSON schema provided by an adaptor, in most cases:
e.g., `language-dhis2` provides a single schema which defines the required
attributes for `state.configuration`, while `language-common` provides multiple
credential schemas like "oauth" or "basic auth" which define attributes for
`state.configuration` and which might be used by lots of different jobs.)
