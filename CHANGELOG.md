  [#2460](https://github.com/OpenFn/lightning/issues/2460)

  > This is a fix for future Workflow updates that are deployed by the CLI and
  > Github integrations. Unfortunately, there is a high likelihood that your
  > existing snapshots could be incorrect (e.g. missing steps, missing edges).
  > In order to fix this, you will need to manually create new snapshots for
  > each of your workflows. This can be done either by modifying the workflow in
  > the UI and saving it. Or running a command on the running instance:
  >
  > ```elixir
  > alias Lightning.Repo
  > alias Lightning.Workflows.{Workflow, Snapshot}
  >
  > Repo.transaction(fn ->
  >   snapshots =
  >     Repo.all(Workflow)
  >     |> Enum.map(&Workflow.touch/1)
  >     |> Enum.map(&Repo.update!/1)
  >     |> Enum.map(fn workflow ->
  >       {:ok, snapshot} = Snapshot.create(workflow)
  >       snapshot
  >     end)
  >
  >  {:ok, snapshots}
  > end)
  > ```

## [v2.7.15] - 2024-08-07

## [2.0.0-rc1] - 2024-01-05

### Why does this repo go from `v0` to `v2.0`?

Lightning is the _2nd version_ of the OpenFn platform. While much of the core
technology is the same, there are breaking changes between `v1.105` (pre-2024)
and `v2` ("OpenFn Lightning").

For customers using OpenFn `v1`, a migration guide will be provided at
[docs.openfn.org](https://docs.openfn.org)

### Added

- Link to the job inspctor for a selected run from the history interface
  [#1524](https://github.com/OpenFn/Lightning/issues/1524)
- Reprocess an existing work order from the job inspector by default (instead of
  always creating a new work order)
  [#1524](https://github.com/OpenFn/Lightning/issues/1524)
- Bumped worker to support edge conditions between trigger and first job
  `"@openfn/ws-worker": "^0.4.0"`

### Changed

- Updated naming to prepare for v2 release
  [#1248](https://github.com/OpenFn/Lightning/issues/1248); the major change is
  that each time a work order (the typical unit of business value for an
  organization, e.g. "execute workflow ABC for patient 123") is executed, it is
  called a "run". Previously, it was called an "attempt". The hierarchy is now:

  ```
  Build-Time: Projects > Workflows > Steps
  Run-Time: Work Orders > Runs > Steps
  ```

  Note the name changes here are reflected in the UI, but not all tables/models
  will be changed until [1571](https://github.com/OpenFn/Lightning/issues/1571)
  is delivered.

## [v0.10.0] - 2023-11-21

### 🚨 Breaking change warning! 🚨

This release will contain breaking changes as we've significantly improved both
the workflow building and execution systems.

#### Nodes and edges

Before, workflows were represented as a list of jobs and triggers. For greater
flexibility and control of complex workflows, we've moved towards a more robust
"nodes and edges" approach. Where jobs in a workflow (a node) can be connected
by edges.

Triggers still exist, but live "outside" the directed acyclic graph (DAG) and
are used to automatically create work orders and attempts.

We've provided migrations that bring `v0.9.3` workflows in line with the
`v0.10.0` requirements.

#### Scalable workers

Before, Lightning spawned child processes to execute attempts in sand-boxed
NodeVMs on the same server. This created inefficiencies and security
vulnerabilities. Now, the Lightning web server adds attempts to a queue and
multiple worker applications can pull from that queue to process work.

In dev mode, this all happens automatically and on one machine, but in most
high-availability production environments the workers will be on another server.

Attempts are now handled entirely by the workers, and they report back to
Lightning. Exit reasons, final attempt states, error types and error messages
are either entirely new or handled differently now, but we have provided
migration scripts that will work to bring _most_ `v0.9.3` runs, attempts, and
work orders up to `v0.10.0`, though the granularity of `v0.9.3` states and exits
will be less than `v0.10.0` and the final states are not guaranteed to be
accurate for workflows with multiple branches and leaf nodes with varying exit
reasons.

The migration scripts can be run with a single function call in SetupUtils from
a connect `iex` session:

```
Lightning.SetupUtils.approximate_state_for_attempts_and_workorders()
```

Note that (like lots of _other_ functionality in `SetupUtils`, calling this
function is a destructive action and you should only do it if you've backed up
your data and you know what you're doing.)

As always, we recommend backing up your data before migrating. (And thanks for
bearing with us as we move towards our first stable Lightning release.)

## [0.5.0] - 2023-04-03

### Added

- Magic functions that fetch real metadata from connected systems via
  `credentials` and suggest completions in the job builder (e.g., pressing
  `control-space` when setting the `orgUnit` attribute for a DHIS2 create
  operation will pull the _actual_ list of orgUnits with human readable labels
  and fill in their orgUnit codes upon
  enter.)[670](https://github.com/OpenFn/Lightning/issues/670)
- A "metadata explorer" to browse actual system metadata for connected
  instances. [658](https://github.com/OpenFn/Lightning/issues/658)

- Instance administrators can now configure the interval between when a project
  owner or user requests deletion and when these records are purged from the
  database. It defaults to 7, but by providing a `PURGE_DELETED_AFTER_DAYS`
  environment variable the grace period can be altered. Note that setting this
  variable to `0` will make automatic purging _never_ occur but will still make
  "deleted" projects and users unavailable. This has been requested by certain
  organizations that must retain audit logs in a Lightning instance.

\*The form is defined by a JSON schema provided by an adaptor, in most cases:
e.g., `language-dhis2` provides a single schema which defines the required
attributes for `state.configuration`, while `language-common` provides multiple
credential schemas like "oauth" or "basic auth" which define attributes for
`state.configuration` and which might be used by lots of different jobs.)
